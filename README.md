🍔 Food-Del – Full Stack Food Delivery Application (MERN)

Food-Del is a full-stack food delivery web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform allows users to browse food items, add them to cart, place orders, and complete secure online payments, while providing admins with full control over food items and order management.

This project demonstrates real-world full-stack development concepts including authentication, REST APIs, payment integration, image uploads, and role-based access control.
